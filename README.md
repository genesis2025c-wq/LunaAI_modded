# LunaAI
LunaAI is a modified version of Ollama that adds additional features on top of the standard Ollama experience. More features are planned as development continues.

# How to Run
Launch the application by double-clicking luna-ai.exe (Windows) or luna-ai from the root directory.

# Notes
If you are using an NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPU (for example 5070, 5080, 5090), you may experience slower performance compared to older well-supported GPUs. This is due to limited optimization and incomplete support for newer architectures in current AI frameworks. This does not indicate a problem with your hardware, can make it work fast/normally but it would take a long time to do so.
I am 15 and a solo dev so do not expect a lot, i do not have time to update this app every week/month :( 
BUT more coming soon!
