# LunaAI
LunaAI is a modified version of Ollama that adds additional features on top of the standard Ollama experience. More features are planned as development continues.

The original README was removed and is being rewritten.

# How to Run
Launch the application by double-clicking luna-ai.exe (Windows) or luna-ai from the root directory.

# Notes
If you are using an NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPU (for example 5070, 5080, 5090), you may experience slower performance compared to older, well-supported GPUs. This is due to limited optimization and incomplete support for newer architectures in current AI frameworks. This does not indicate a problem with your hardware.
I am 15 and a solo dev so do not expect a lot, i do not have time to update this app every week/month :( 
BUT more coming soon!
